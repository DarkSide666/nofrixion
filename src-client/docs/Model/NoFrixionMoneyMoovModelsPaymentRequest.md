## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **string** |  | [optional]
**merchant_id** | **string** |  | [optional]
**amount** | **float** | The amount of money to request. | [optional]
**currency** | **string** | The currency of the request. | [optional]
**customer_id** | **string** | An optional customer identifier for the payment request. | [optional]
**order_id** | **string** | An optional order ID for the payment request. If the request is for an invoice this  is the most appropriate field for the invoice ID. | [optional]
**payment_methods** | **string[]** | The payment methods that the payment request supports. | [optional]
**description** | **string** | An optional description for the payment request. If set this field will appear  on the transaction record for some card processors. | [optional]
**pisp_account_id** | **string** | The payment account ID to use to receive payment initiation payments. This must match one of your  NoFrixion payment account IDs. This can be left blank to use your default payment account. | [optional]
**base_origin_url** | **string** | For card payments the origin of the payment page needs to be set in advance.  A public key context is generated to encrypt sensitive card details and is bound  to a single origin URL. | [optional]
**callback_url** | **string** | Once a payment is processed, or a notification of an inbound payment is received,  a callback request will be made to this URL. Typically it will be the page on  a merchant&#39;s web site that displays the results of the payment attempt. | [optional]
**failure_callback_url** | **string** | Optional callback URL for payment failures that can occur when the payer is   redirected away from the payment page. Typically the payer is only sent away  from the payment page for pay by bank attempts. If this URL is not set the   payer will be redirected back to the original URL the payment attempt was initiated  from. | [optional]
**success_web_hook_url** | **string** | If a payment event results in the payment request being classified as fully paid this  success webhook URL will be invoked. The URL will be invoked as a GET request, i.e.  there will be no request body. Two query parameters will be added to the URL. The   first one will be \&quot;id\&quot; and will hold the payment request ID. The second one will be  \&quot;orderid\&quot; and will hold the payment request OrderID, note the OrderID could be empty  if it was not set when the payment request was created.  The recommended approach when receiving a success web hook is to use the \&quot;id\&quot; parameter  to call the moneymoov get payment request endpoint to retrieve the full details of the  payment request and check the status. Web hooks can be easily spoofed and should not be  relied upon. | [optional]
**card_authorize_only** | **bool** | For card payments the default behaviour is to authorise and capture the payment at the same  time. If a merchant needs to authorise and then capture at a later point this property needs  to be set to true. | [optional]
**card_create_token** | **bool** | For card payments a payment attempt can be used to create a reusable token for subsequent  payments. Setting this field to true will create a reusable customer token. | [optional]
**card_create_token_mode** | **string** | This specifies whether user consent will be taken before tokenising card or not.  If this is set to &#39;UserConsentRequired&#39; then, the user consent will potentially update   CardCreateToken flag on submit card payment. | [optional]
**ignore_address_verification** | **bool** | If set to true the card payment gateway will be directed to proceed with a payment even if the  address verification checks fails. | [optional]
**card_ignore_cvn** | **bool** | If set to true the card payment gateway will be directed to proceed with a payment even if the  card verification number check fails. | [optional]
**card_processor_merchant_id** | **string** | Optional field that if specified indicates the processor merchant ID that should be used  to process any card payments. Mainly useful where a merchant has multiple processor  merchant ID&#39;s. If left empty the default merchant card settings will be used. | [optional]
