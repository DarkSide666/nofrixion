**allow_incomplete** | **bool** | If set to true the payout will get updated even if the business validation   rules fail. The basic data validation rules must still pass. The original   purpose of this flag was to allow payouts to be created from i3rd party applications,  such as Xero, that may not have things like an IBAN set for a supplier.  The missing information must be filled, either by an update from the 3rd party  application, or manually, before the payout can be submitted for processing. | [optional]

**bitcoin_subtract_fee_from_amount** | **bool** | For Bitcoin payouts, when this flag is set the network fee will be deducted from the send amount.  This is particularly useful for sweeps where it can be difficult to calculate the exact fee required. | [optional]
**bitcoin_fee_sats_per_vbyte** | **int** | The Bitcoin fee rate to apply in Satoshis per virtual byte. | [optional]
**payment_rail** | **string** | Optional field to indicate the payment rail to use for the payout. Currrently only  supports choosing between SEPA-CT and SEPA-INST for EUR payments.
